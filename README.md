## Creating a Sustainable Hacker Community
* How do you create a *community*?
* How do you create a *culture*?
* How do you sustain its growth and development?

Our team representing BoilerMake has been lucky to piece together the wisdom of those who came before us.  With a passion to __create__ and __contribute__, we have become involved to spearhead the growth and sustainability of Purdue’s *hacker culture*.

With the mission to continue that culture, we want to touch on the efforts and vision it takes to __create__ and __sustain__ a hacker community.

# Notes
Audrey is the treasurer of the Computer Science Women’s Network, the Design team lead on BoilerMake, Purdue Hackers exec (organized Hello World, a freshman hackathon), and was involved in LaunchPad. Kedar is the director of LaunchPad (freshman mentorship program) and the Dev team lead on BoilerMake. We are both deeply involved within our hacker community at Purdue, and play vital roles in various clubs that make up the community.

### Abstract Continued

There were several realizations that helped us achieve the community that we have today. 

First, we learned that bringing in new members to your community keeps your community young and sustains future growth. We addressed this with programs targeted towards freshmen, such as 
* freshman-only hackathon (Hello World)
* one-to-one freshman mentorship program that pairs freshmen with upperclassmen. 

Purdue would not be successful without the support and constant effort of new organizations. The community as a whole has since organically branched out into creating
* BoilerMake (annual hackathon, 500+ hackers from 20+ schools)
* LaunchPad (mentorship program)
* Web Dev Club
* iOS Club
* CSWN (women’s network)
* AMCS (diversity related), and many more! 

We believe that these events hosted by various organizations at Purdue, such as hack nights, coding challenge events, tech talks, workshops, and movie nights keeps the community invigorated and involved. 

While tech talks and workshops are great for teaching students technical skills, we emphasize that events (like hack nights) that allow community members to gather and spend time together are the events that truly build strong relationships. 

Finally, we realized that people care about things that they’re responsible for, and lowering the barriers for leadership positions results in new members joining and creating meaningful effect on their organization. We would like to speak at HackCon to discuss our findings after years of experimentation at Purdue, so that we can help others grow and sustain their own vibrant hacker communities.
